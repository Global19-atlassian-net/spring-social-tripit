	<title>Adding Support for a New Service Provider</title>
	<para>
		Spring Social makes it easy to add support for service providers that are not already supported by the framework.
		If you review the existing client modules, such as spring-social-twitter and spring-social-facebook, you will discover they are implemented in a consistent manner and they apply a set of well-defined extension points.
		In this section, you will learn how to add support for new service providers you wish to integrate into your applications.

	<section id="service-providers-implementing">
		<title>Process</title>
		<para>
			The process of adding support for a new service provider consists of several steps:

		<title>Creating a source project for the provider client code</title>
		<para>
			A Spring Social client module is simply a standard Java project that builds a single jar artifact e.g. spring-social-twitter.jar.

		<section id="service-providers-implementing-project-structure">
			<title>Code structure recommendations</title>
			<para>
				We recommend all code for a new Spring Social client module fall within the <code>org.springframework.social.{providerId}</code> base package,
				where {providerId} is a unique identifier you assign to the service provider you are adding support for.
				Consider some of the providers already supported by the framework as examples:

				Here, the central service API type, TwitterApi, is located in the api package along with its supporting operations types and data transfer object types.
				The primary implementation of that interface, TwitterTemplate, is located in the api.impl package (along with other package-private impl types have that been excluded from this view).
				Finally, the connect package contains the implementations of various connect SPIs that enable connections to Twitter to be established and persisted.

		<title>Developing a Java binding to the provider's API</title>
		<para>
			Spring Social favors the development of strongly-typed Java bindings to external service provider APIs.
			This provides a simple, domain-oriented interface for Java applications to use to consume the API.
			When adding support for a new service provider, if no suitable Java binding already exists you'll need to develop one.
			If one already exists, such as Twitter4j for example, it is possible to integrate it into the framework.

		<section id="service-provider-implementing-api-new-designing">
			<title>Designing a new Java API binding</title>
			<para>
				API developers retain full control over the design and implementation of their Java bindings.
				That said, we offer several design guidelines in an effort to improve overall consistency and quality:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							<emphasis>Favor separating the API binding interface from the implementation.</emphasis>
							This is illustrated in the spring-social-twitter example in the previous section.
							There, "TwitterApi" is the central API binding type and it is declared in the org.springframework.social.twitter.api package with other public types.
							"TwitterTemplate" is the primary implementation of this interface and is located in the org.springframework.social.twitter.api.impl subpackage along with other package-private implementation types.
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							<emphasis>Favor organizing the API binding hierarchically by RESTful resource.</emphasis>
							REST-based APIs typically expose access to a number of resources in an hierarchical manner.
							For example, Twitter's API provides access to "status timelines", "searches", "lists", "direct messages", "friends", and "users".
							Rather than add all operations across these resources to a single flat "TwitterApi" interface, the TwitterApi interface is organized hierarchically:
							<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public interface TwitterApi {
	
    DirectMessageOperations directMessageOperations();

    FriendOperations friendOperations();

    ListOperations listOperations();

    SearchOperations searchOperations();
	
    TimelineOperations timelineOperations();

    UserOperations userOperations();

}]]></programlisting>
						</para>
						<para>
							DirectMessageOperations, for example, contains API bindings to Twitter's "direct_messages" resource:
							<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public interface DirectMessageOperations {

    List<DirectMessage> getDirectMessagesReceived();

    List<DirectMessage> getDirectMessagesSent();

    void sendDirectMessage(String toScreenName, String text);

    void sendDirectMessage(long toUserId, String text);
	
    void deleteDirectMessage(long messageId);
}]]>
							</programlisting>
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="service-provider-implementing-api-new-implementing">
			<title>Implementing a new Java API binding</title>
			<para>
				API developers are free to implement their Java API binding with whatever REST/HTTP client they see fit.
				That said, Spring Social's existing API bindings such as spring-social-twitter all use Spring Framework's RestTemplate in conjunction with the Jackson JSON ObjectMapper and Apache HttpComponents HTTP client.
				RestTemplate is a popular REST client that provides a uniform object mapping interface across a variety of data exchange formats (JSON, XML, etc).
				Jackson is the leading Java-based JSON marshalling technology.
				Apache HttpComponents has proven to be the most robust HTTP client (if it is not available on the classpath Spring Social will fallback to standard J2SE facilities, however).
				To help promote consistency across Spring Social's supported bindings, we do recommend you consider these implementation technologies (and please let us know if they do not meet your needs).
			</para>
			<para>
				Spring Social has adopted a convention where each API implementation class is named "{ProviderId}Template" e.g. TwitterTemplate.
				We favor this convention unless there is a good reason to deviate from it.
				As discussed in the previous section, we recommend keeping implementation types separate from the public API types.
				We also recommend keeping internal implementation details package-private.
			</para>
			<para>
				The way in which an API binding implementation is constructed will vary based on the API's authorization protocol.
				For APIs secured with OAuth1, the consumerKey, consumerSecret, accessToken, and accessTokenSecret will be required for construction:
				<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public TwitterTemplate(String consumerKey, String consumerSecret, String accessToken, String accessTokenSecret) { ... }]]>
				</programlisting>				
			</para>
			<para>
				For OAuth2, only the access token should be required:
				<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public FacebookTemplate(String accessToken) { ... }]]>
				</programlisting>
			</para>
			<para>
				Each request made to the API's "resource server" needs to be signed with the authorization credentials provided during construction.
				This signing process consists of adding an "Authorization" header to each client request before it is executed.
				For OAuth1, the process is quite complicated, and is used to support an elaborate request signature verification algorithm between the client and server.
				For OAuth2, it is a lot simpler, but does still vary across the various drafts of the OAuth2 specification.
			</para>
			<para>
				To encapsulate this complexity, for each authorization protocol Spring Social provides a ProtectedResourceClientFactory you may use to
				construct a pre-configured RestTemplate instance that performs the request signing for you. For OAuth1:
				<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public TwitterTemplate(String consumerKey, String consumerSecret, String accessToken, String accessTokenSecret) {
    this.restTemplate = ProtectedResourceClientFactory.create(consumerKey, consumerSecret, accessToken, accessTokenSecret);
}]]>			</programlisting>
			</para>
			<para>
				An OAuth2 example:
				<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public FacebookTemplate(String accessToken) {
    this.restTemplate = ProtectedResourceClientFactory.draft10(accessToken);
}]]>
				</programlisting>
			</para>
			<para>
				Once the REST client has been configured as shown above, you simply use it to implement the various API operations.
				The existing Spring Social client modules all invoke their RestTemplate instances in a standard manner:
				<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public TwitterProfile getUserProfile() {
    return restTemplate.getForObject(buildUri("account/verify_credentials.json"), TwitterProfile.class);
}]]>
				</programlisting>
			</para>
			<para>
				A note on RestTemplate usage: we do favor the RestTemplate methods that accept a URI object instead of a uri String.
				This ensures we always properly encode client data submitted in URI query parameters, such as screen_name below:
				<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public TwitterProfile getUserProfile(String screenName) {
    return restTemplate.getForObject(buildUri("users/show.json", Collections.singletonMap("screen_name", screenName)), TwitterProfile.class);
}]]>
				</programlisting>
			</para>
			<para>
				For complete implementation examples, consult the existing API bindings included in Spring Social.
				<code>spring-social-twitter</code> and <code>spring-social-facebook</code> provide particularly good references.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="service-provider-implementing-api-new-testing">
			<title>Testing a new Java API binding</title>
			<para>
				As part of the spring-social-test module, Spring Social includes a framework for unit testing API bindings:
				This framework consists of a "MockRestServiceServer" that can be used to mock out API calls to the remote service provider.
				This allows for the development of independent, performant, automated unit tests that verify client API binding and object mapping behavior.
			</para>
			<para>
				To use, first create a MockRestServiceServer against the RestTemplate instance used by your API implementation:
			</para>
			<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
TwitterTemplate twitter = new TwitterTemplate("API_KEY", "API_SECRET", "ACCESS_TOKEN", "ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET");
MockRestServer mockServer = MockRestServiceServer.createServer(twitter.getRestTemplate());]]>
			</programlisting>
			<para>
				Then, for each test case, record expectations about how the server should be invoked and answer what it should respond with:
			</para>
			<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
@Test
public void getUserProfile() {
    HttpHeaders responseHeaders = new HttpHeaders();
    responseHeaders.setContentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);
    
    mockServer.expect(requestTo("https://api.twitter.com/1/account/verify_credentials.json"))
        .andExpect(method(GET))
        .andRespond(withResponse(jsonResource("verify-credentials"), responseHeaders));

    TwitterProfile profile = twitter.userOperations().getUserProfile();
    assertEquals(161064614, profile.getId());
    assertEquals("kdonald", profile.getScreenName());
}]]>
			</programlisting>
			<para>
				In the example above the response body is written from a verify-credentials.json file located in the same package as the test class:
			</para>
			<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
private Resource jsonResource(String filename) {
    return new ClassPathResource(filename + ".json", getClass());
}]]>
			</programlisting>
			<para>
				The content of the file should mirror the content the remote service provider would return, allowing the client JSON deserialization behavior to be fully tested:
			</para>
			<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
{
    "id":161064614,
    "screen_name":"kdonald"
}]]>
			</programlisting>
			<para>
				For complete test examples, consult the existing API bindings included in Spring Social.
				<code>spring-social-twitter</code> and <code>spring-social-facebook</code> provide particularly good references.

			<title>Integrating an existing Java API binding</title>
			<para>
				If you are adding support for a popular service provider, chances are a Java binding to the provider's API may already exist.
				For example, the Twitter4j library has been around for awhile and provides a complete binding to Twitter's API.
				Instead of developing your own binding, you may simply wish to integrate what already exists.
				Spring Social's connect framework has been carefully designed to support this scenario.
			</para>
			<para>
				To integrate an existing API binding, simply note the binding's primary API interface and implementation.
				For example, in Twitter4j the main API interface is named "Twitter" and instances are constructed by a TwitterFactory.
				You can always construct such an API instance directly, and you'll see in the following sections how to expose an instance as part of a ServiceProviderConnection.
