GitHub Showcase
===============
This showcase application serves to demonstrate many of the features that Spring Social offers for interacting
with GitHub. 

At this time, this showcase demonstrates:
 - Connecting to GitHub using Spring Social's ConnectController and the OAuth 2 web server flow.
 - Specifying an OAuth 2 authorization scope via an optional "scope" parameter to the ConnectController
   at authorization time
 - Retrieving a user's GitHub ID.
 - Retrieving a user's top spots (the spots that the user has checked into most).
 
To keep things simple this showcase application is a single-user application, assuming that the user's application
account ID is always 1. A more comprehensive example would be multi-user keeping a store of users, any of which
may connect their application account with their GitHub profile.

The functionality of this showcase sample will be expanded as Spring Social offers more GitHub capability.
