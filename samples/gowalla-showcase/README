Gowalla Showcase
================
This showcase application serves to demonstrate many of the features that Spring Social offers for interacting
with Gowalla. 

At this time, this showcase demonstrates:
 - Connecting to Gowalla using Spring Social's ConnectController and the OAuth 2 web server flow.
 - Retrieving a user's Gowalla ID.
 - Retrieving a user's top spots (the spots that the user has checked into most).
 
To keep things simple this showcase application is a single-user application, assuming that the user's application
account ID is always 1. A more comprehensive example would be multi-user keeping a store of users, any of which
may connect their application account with their Gowalla profile.

The functionality of this showcase sample will be expanded as Spring Social offers more Gowalla capability.
