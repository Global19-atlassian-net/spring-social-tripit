Twitter Showcase
================
This showcase application serves to demonstrate many of the features that Spring Social offers for interacting
with Twitter. 

At this time, this showcase demonstrates:
 - Connecting to Twitter using Spring Social's ConnectController and OAuth 1.0a.
 - The ability to connect multiple Twitter identities to a single application user. (Note that after the first
   connection, you'll need to "logout" of Twitter and login as a different Twitter user when prompted for
   authorization by Twitter.)
 - Posting a status message to any or all of the connected Twitter profile timelines.
 - Using Spring Social's configuration namespace to declare a Twitter-based service provider.
 
To keep things simple this showcase application is a single-user application, assuming that the user's application
account ID is always 1. A more comprehensive example would be multi-user keeping a store of users, any of which
may connect their application account with their Twitter profile.

The functionality of this showcase sample will be expanded as Spring Social offers more Twitter capability.
