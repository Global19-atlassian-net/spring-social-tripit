Facebook Showcase
=================
This showcase application serves to demonstrate many of the features that Spring Social offers for interacting
with Facebook. This particular showcase example leverages Facebook's XFBML and JavaScript APIs to establish
connections between the application user and their Facebook profile. (Another Facebook showcase sample,
facebook-showcase-2, demonstrates how to use Spring Social to establish connections following OAuth 2's
web server flow).

At this time, this showcase demonstrates:
 - Connecting to Facebook via Facebook's <fb:login-button> tag.
 - Using Spring Social's @FacebookAccessToken and @FacebookUserId annotations to extract a user's access token
   and user ID from the cookie that is written after authorization.
 - Retrieving a user's Facebook profile data.
 - Posting a message to the user's Facebook wall.
 
To keep things simple this showcase application is a single-user application, assuming that the user's application
account ID is always 1. A more comprehensive example would be multi-user keeping a store of users, any of which
may connect their application account with their Facebook profile.

The functionality of this showcase sample will be expanded as Spring Social offers more Facebook capability.
