Facebook Showcase 2
===================
This showcase application serves to demonstrate many of the features that Spring Social offers for interacting
with Facebook. This particular showcase example uses Spring Social's ConnectController to establish connections
with Facebook using the OAuth 2 web server flow. (Another Facebook showcase sample, facebook-showcase, demonstrates 
how to use Spring Social to establish connections using Facebook's XFBML and JavaScript APIs).

At this time, this showcase demonstrates:
 - Connecting to Facebook using Spring Social's ConnectController and the OAuth 2 web server flow.
 - Specifying an OAuth 2 authorization scope via an optional "scope" parameter to the ConnectController
   at authorization time
 - Retrieving a user's Facebook profile data.
 - Posting a message to the user's Facebook wall.
 
To keep things simple this showcase application is a single-user application, assuming that the user's application
account ID is always 1. A more comprehensive example would be multi-user keeping a store of users, any of which
may connect their application account with their Facebook profile.

The functionality of this showcase sample will be expanded as Spring Social offers more Facebook capability.
